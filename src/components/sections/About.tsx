          <p>
            I'm Alif, a fresh graduate in Information Technology from Brawijaya
            University with a strong passion for front-end development.
            Originally from Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia, I love exploring
            modern web technologies and continuously seek opportunities to learn
            and grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey began with a deep curiosity and a passion for creating
            meaningful digital experiences. This passion led me to earn a
            scholarship from{" "}
            <a href="https://idcamp.ioh.co.id/" target="_blank">
              <strong>
                <u> ID Camp</u>
              </strong>
            </a>
            , where I learned the fundamentals of front-end development and
            React.js up to the intermediate level. After completing the program,
            I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects during my
            internship at{" "}
            <a href="https://aksamedia.co.id/" target="_blank">
              <strong>

              </strong>
            </a>
            , where I gained hands-on experience in building and maintaining
            complex web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of tech, Iâ€™m passionate about health and wellness, enjoy
            watching movies, and occasionally unwind with video games.
